This is a readme file!

This folder includes the following Python files:
>> Graph0_HelperFunc.py
>> Hypergraph0_HelperFunc.py
>> Hypergraph1_RunWorker.py
>> Hypergraph2_PlotData.py
>> Hypergraph3_ThreeDPlot.py

Step 1:
Please save the two helper function Graph0_HelperFunc.py and Hypergraph0_HelperFunc.py
These are helper functions and contain the required tools.
Graph0_HelperFunc.py >> Include graph related algorithms 
Hypergraph0_HelperFunc.py >> Include hypergraph related algorithms 

Step 2:
Please run the function Hypergraph1_RunWorker.py
This functions calls parallel workers to simulate and save the data for percolation in hypergraph quantum network 
follow the instructions prompted on the terminal to save the data 

Step 3:
